experience:
  - company: "Global Consulting Firm"
    location: "Boston, MA"
    role: "AI Transformation & Governance Lead"
    start_date: "2025-10"
    end_date: "Present"
    highlights:
      - "Authored an AI strategic plan with a Crawl–Walk–Run maturity model aligned to NIST AI RMF and practical delivery constraints."
      - "Designed a TRACE-style methodology and TILETS learning loop for governed, auditable AI-assisted content production; achieved >60% workforce enablement and built an internal champion network."
      - "Delivered 15+ AI assistants and reusable workflows; reduced manual reporting time ~40% and accelerated test design cycles ~30%."
      - "Enabled rapid executive-ready packaging of complex workstreams by separating deterministic artifact generation from final narrative framing."
      - "Built lightweight CLI automation and folder contracts so outputs were traceable, reproducible, and safe to reuse."

    location: "Remote"
    role: "Builder — Intent-to-Artifact Workflows"
    start_date: "2025-10"
    end_date: "Present"
    highlights:
      - "Designed and implemented an “Intent Foundry” approach: staged human–AI collaboration that turns ambiguous intent into tempered, traceable, execution-ready artifacts."
      - "Added recasting (forward intent→outputs and reverse outputs→evidence→inferred intent) to enable validation, auditability, and alternate stakeholder perspectives."
      - "Standardized run packaging so any run can be re-issued as a single executive-ready document driven by run-scoped YAML specifications."
      - "Practiced a tool-neutral AI co-collaboration model (e.g., Windsurf/Cascade) focused on durable artifacts, not chat transcripts."
